    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Doner meat kebabs are popular take-out foods, especially after a night at the pub. This favorite is so tasty â€” I'm sure once you try it, you'll certainly want to make more! Serve with warmed (lightly toasted) pita bread, chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. Also great to add as a topping for pizzas. Great to make in advance, slice and freeze.</p>
